# Understanding contributors
Most contributors take a gradual path to getting involved in an open source community. It usually looks something like this:

 1.Reporting a bug
 2.Suggesting a new feature
 3.Creating a pull request
 
More seasoned open source contributors might go straight to creating their first pull request, so adding helpful templates to a repository that makes it easier for everyone to get involved, regardless of their previous experience.

## Step 6: Adding an issue template
When you add an issue template and pull request template to your repository, project contributors will automatically see the template's contents when they open a new issue or pull request. Templates help you standardize the information you'd like included when contributors open issues.

## Creating multiple templates
In open source projects, templates make it easy for new contributors to create bug reports, suggest new features, or contribute changes. Mona has already created an issue template for new, can you put one together for bugs?
